# TODOs

## Goals:
- Design and implement a documented RESTful API for the game (think of a mobile app for your API)


## API Features:
    - Ability to support multiple users/accounts
    - Ability to start a new game and preserve/resume the old ones
    - Ability to select the game parameters: number of rows, columns, and mines
    - Ability to 'flag' a cell with a question mark or red flag
    - When a cell with no adjacent mines is revealed, all adjacent squares will be revealed (and repeat)
    - Persistence
    - Time tracking
    - Detect when game is over


## Deliverables (in order of importance):
    1. Code in a public Github repo
    2. README file with the decisions taken and important notes
    3. URL where the game can be accessed and played (heroku.com, aws.amazon.com, etc)


## Desirables:
- Implement an API client library for the API designed above. Ideally, in a different language, of your preference, to the one used for the API


## Action Plan:
    - [] Draft API resources along with its endpoints and respective database models
    - [] Implement API database models
    - [] Implement API endpoints
    - [] Create Postman collection for testing API endpoints
    - [] Write README file
    - [] Create unit-tests for
    - [] Document code
